a , b = 10 , 3
print(a+b)#addition
print(a-b)#subtraction
print(a*b)#multiplication
print(a/b)#division : returns quotient in floating point
print(a%b)#modulus : returns remainder
print(a**b)# ** is exponent operator and it calculates a^b
print(a//b)# it is floor division operator it returns the quotient in integer value and removes decimal point

#assignment operators
x = y = 10 #assigns 10 value to both x & y variables
x += y #this means x = x+y . This is called compound assignment . This is similar to all operators.
print(x)
#more examples : x-= y , x *= y , x/= y , x %= y , x **= y , x //= y
#the value after these operations is assigned to x
